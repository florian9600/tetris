# tetris
Tetris game made during my first semester of Computer Science study. Because of how early it was, I had no knowledge in object programming and it's all done in a structural way. Nonetheless it is a nice little game and it works perfectly.

The language used is C++. For creating 2D graphics I decided to use SDL2 library. It was made by me explicitly for macOS, but it should be possible to compile the code also for other platforms, like Windows, Linux, Mobile, etc.

In project files you can find the executable file "tetris.app", so if you are running on a Mac you can just download and start playing.

Controls:
n - new game
[left] [right] - moving the tiles left and right
[up] - rotating
[down] - making fall faster
s - save
l - load
p - pause
